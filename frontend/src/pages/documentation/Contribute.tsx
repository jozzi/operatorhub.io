            If you have an Operator you would like to contribute to OperatorHub.io, feel free to create a pull request
            against the above directory. Please read the pull request&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorsRepoBeforePR} text="requirements" />
            &nbsp;before creating one to ensure all required files are present.
          </p>
          <p>
            The easiest way to package your Operator for OperatorHub.io is to build it with the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorSdk} text="Operator SDK" />, however it is
            not a requirement. To publish your Operator, it must be built as a binary within a container, and that
            container must be hosted on a publicly accessible&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorRegistry} text="registry" />. It should be
            accompanied by some&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.operatorsRepoRequirements} text="metadata" /> that
            is used for deploying the Operator using the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.olm} text="Operator Lifecycle Manager" /> in
            addition to rendering the Operator’s detail page on OperatorHub.io.

        <React.Fragment>
          <p>
            Your Operator should be able to be managed by the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.olm} text="Operator Lifecycle Manager" /> (OLM).
            This component of the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.gettingStarted} text="Operator Framework" /> is
            deployed on your Kubernetes cluster and will be able to install the Operator via CLI or through a GUI
            component like embedded OperatorHub in OpenShift. Either way, this requires some catalog data to be created
            in the form of YAML manifests that follow a specific directory structure.
          </p>
          <h3>Operator Bundle Editor</h3>
          <p>
            You can now create your Operator bundle from Operatorhub.io using the&nbsp;
            <InternalLink route="/packages" history={history}>
              bundle editor
            </InternalLink>
            . Starting by uploading your Kubernetes YAML manifests, the forms on the page will be populated with all
            valid information and used to create the new Operator bundle. You can modify or add properties through these
            forms as well.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The Operator bundle editor is now available in beta.&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.fileAnIssue} indicator>Feedback and questions</ExternalLink> are encouraged.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Let’s take a look at an example from the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.contributions} text="community repository" />:
          </p>
          <p>
            Your catalog data should live in a flat directory named after your Operator, e.g. the following files exist
            for the&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.prometheusOperator} text="Prometheus Operator" />
            &nbsp;in a directory called <code>prometheus</code>.
          </p>
          {renderTable()}
          <p>
            This catalog data will enable OLM to serve, install, and update your Operator in a predictable way instead
            of requiring cluster maintainers to manually deploy (e.g. <code>kubectl create -f ...</code>) required
            manifests that contain CRDs, RBAC rules, Service Accounts, Deployments etc. If you want to learn more about
            how OLM does this, read about it&nbsp;
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.olmArchitecture} text="here" />.
          </p>
          <h3>Custom Resource Definitions:</h3>
          <p>
            These should already exist if your Operator watches CRDs. Place each CRD that your Operator owns in it’s own
            YAML file. CRDs that your Operator does not own but watches are handled by OLMs dependency management.
          </p>
          <h3>Cluster Service Version:</h3>
          <p>
            {`
            The bulk of your Operator's catalog metadata will reside in a CSV file, of which there is one per version of
            your Operator. This file contains the specifications of how to deploy your Operator, and information on
            which CRDs it owns and those it depends on from other Operators. In addition this is where you put a
            description, logo, version, maturity level, authoring info, links etc. for your Operator. This information
            will be used to render the detail page on OperatorHub.io. Follow$&nbsp;
            `}
            <ExternalLink href={documentationLinks.buildYourCSV} text="these instructions" /> to
            create this file.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you add CSV files for newer versions of your Operator, don’t forget to use the <code>spec.replaces</code>
            &nbsp;property to point to the previous version.
          </p>
          <h3>Package Manifest:</h3>
          <p>
            {`
            The package manifest is a simple list of channels that point to a particular CSV name. This allows OLM to
            serve the Operator from multiple channels, each named to convey that CSV versions' stability and update
            frequency, e.g. stable and alpha. Your package manifest must have at least one channel. For reference, use
            one of the examples in the$&nbsp;
            `}

          <p>
            If you are developing your Operator with the Operator SDK you can simply create most of this catalog data by
            running the following command:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>$ operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv --csv-version xx.yy.zz</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            {`
            This will scaffold a CSV within the <code>xx.yy.zz</code> subdirectory of your Operator's$&nbsp;
            `}
            <code>deploy</code> directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            To version your CRDs alongside your CSV, pass the <code>--update-crds</code> flag to the above command. This
            will copy your CRDs into the <code>xx.yy.zz</code> subdirectory, effectively creating an Operator bundle for
            you to register.
